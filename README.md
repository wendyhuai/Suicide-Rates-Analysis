# Suicide-Rates-Analysis

Mental health is very important to all of us in our fast-paced life. Many NGOs and schools are holding a lot of activities in promoting a healthy mental state. When we browsing data on Kaggle, one data about suicide rates caught our eyes. We are very interested in suicide rates, which is severe mental health to the extreme.

Supposedly, people in developed countries should be in a good economic state and should have good lives. On the other hand, we think that these developed countries also encourage individuality and people are likely to be open about suicides. We would like to take a deeper look at the data to find out what factors are associated with suicide rates. The dataset has suicide and economic records from 101 countries for different ages and generations. a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.

Variables in our dataset includes:

- Year
- Country
- Age
- Sex: Female & Male
- Suicide Rates: suicides/100k population
- GDP
- GDP per capita
- HDI: a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development.
- Generations: people born in
  - 2000 to present: Generation Z.
  - 1980 to 2000: Millennials
  - 1965 to 1979: Generation X.
  - 1946 to 1964: Boomers.
  - 1925 to 1945: Silent Generation.
  - 1900 to 1924: G.I. Generation.
  
Because the entire dataset has worldwide data and is hard to find insights, we want to narrow down our research area into two regions. We want to compare regions where we normally associated with good social welfare and peaceful life, and where with political conflicts and constant wars. We choose middle east and northern Europe as these two regions and select five countries with the largest population within these two regions.
